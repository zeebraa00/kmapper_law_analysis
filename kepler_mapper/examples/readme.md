## Linking locally

With `link_local=True` you can link up the local clusters (clusters in the same hypercube). Below 
you can see a low-resolution house cat on the left *without local linking* and *with local linking* on 
the right.

## Digits

In the `digits` directory you'll find an example of using the `custom_tooltips`-functionality. It also 
shows the usage of `reducer` with t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality to 2.

Note how sub-clusters form for digits with a different slant.
